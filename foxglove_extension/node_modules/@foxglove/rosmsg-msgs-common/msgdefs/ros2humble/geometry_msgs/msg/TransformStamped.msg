# This expresses a transform from coordinate frame header.frame_id
# to the coordinate frame child_frame_id at the time of header.stamp
#
# This message is mostly used by the

# See its documentation for more information.
#
# The child_frame_id is necessary in addition to the frame_id
# in the Header to communicate the full reference for the transform
# in a self contained message.

# The frame id in the header is used as the reference frame of this transform.

# The frame id of the child frame to which this transform points.
string child_frame_id

# Translation and rotation in 3-dimensions of child_frame_id from header.frame_id.

MSG: std_msgs/Header
# Standard metadata for higher-level stamped data types.
# This is generally used to communicate timestamped data
# in a particular coordinate frame.

# Two-integer timestamp that is expressed as seconds and nanoseconds.

# Transform frame with which this data is associated.

MSG: geometry_msgs/Transform
# This represents the transform between two coordinate frames in free space.

Vector3 translation
Quaternion rotation

================================================================================
MSG: geometry_msgs/Vector3
# This represents a vector in free space.

# This is semantically different than a point.
# A vector is always anchored at the origin.
# When a transform is applied to a vector, only the rotational component is applied.

# This represents an orientation in free space in quaternion form.
