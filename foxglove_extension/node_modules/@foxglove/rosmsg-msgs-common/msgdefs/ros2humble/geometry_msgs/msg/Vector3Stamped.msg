# This represents a Vector3 with reference coordinate frame and timestamp

# Note that this follows vector semantics with it always anchored at the origin,
# so the rotational elements of a transform are the only parts applied when transforming.

MSG: std_msgs/Header
# Standard metadata for higher-level stamped data types.
# This is generally used to communicate timestamped data
# in a particular coordinate frame.

# Two-integer timestamp that is expressed as seconds and nanoseconds.

# Transform frame with which this data is associated.

================================================================================
MSG: geometry_msgs/Vector3
# This represents a vector in free space.

# This is semantically different than a point.
# A vector is always anchored at the origin.
# When a transform is applied to a vector, only the rotational component is applied.
