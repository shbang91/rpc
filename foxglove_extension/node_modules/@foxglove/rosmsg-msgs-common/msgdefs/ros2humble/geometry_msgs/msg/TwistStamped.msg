# Standard metadata for higher-level stamped data types.
# This is generally used to communicate timestamped data
# in a particular coordinate frame.

# Two-integer timestamp that is expressed as seconds and nanoseconds.

# This expresses velocity in free space broken into its linear and angular parts.

Vector3  linear
Vector3  angular

================================================================================
MSG: geometry_msgs/Vector3
# This represents a vector in free space.

# This is semantically different than a point.
# A vector is always anchored at the origin.
# When a transform is applied to a vector, only the rotational component is applied.
