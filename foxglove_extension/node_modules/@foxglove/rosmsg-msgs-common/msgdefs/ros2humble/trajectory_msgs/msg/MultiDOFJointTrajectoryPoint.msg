geometry_msgs/Transform[] transforms

# There can be a velocity specified for the origin of the joint.
geometry_msgs/Twist[] velocities

# There can be an acceleration specified for the origin of the joint.

MSG: geometry_msgs/Transform
# This represents the transform between two coordinate frames in free space.

Vector3 translation
Quaternion rotation

================================================================================
MSG: geometry_msgs/Twist
# This expresses velocity in free space broken into its linear and angular parts.

Vector3  linear
Vector3  angular

================================================================================
MSG: geometry_msgs/Vector3
# This represents a vector in free space.

# This is semantically different than a point.
# A vector is always anchored at the origin.
# When a transform is applied to a vector, only the rotational component is applied.

MSG: geometry_msgs/Quaternion
# This represents an orientation in free space in quaternion form.
