# This message holds a collection of N-dimensional points, which may
# contain additional information such as normals, intensity, etc. The
# point data is stored as a binary blob, its layout described by the
# contents of the "fields" array.
#
# The point cloud data may be organized 2d (image-like) or 1d (unordered).
# Point clouds organized as 2d images may be produced by camera depth sensors
# such as stereo or time-of-flight.

# Time of sensor data acquisition, and the coordinate frame ID (for 3d points).

# 2D structure of the point cloud. If the cloud is unordered, height is
# 1 and width is the length of the point cloud.
