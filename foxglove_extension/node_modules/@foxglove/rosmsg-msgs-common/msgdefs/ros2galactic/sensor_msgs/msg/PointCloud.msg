## THIS MESSAGE IS DEPRECATED AS OF FOXY
## Please use sensor_msgs/PointCloud2

# This message holds a collection of 3d points, plus optional additional
# information about each point.

# Time of sensor data acquisition, coordinate frame ID.
std_msgs/Header header

# Array of 3d points. Each Point32 should be interpreted as a 3d point
# in the frame given in the header.
geometry_msgs/Point32[] points

# Each channel should have the same number of elements as points array,
# and the data in each channel should correspond 1:1 with each point.
# Channel names in common practice are listed in ChannelFloat32.msg.

# Standard metadata for higher-level stamped data types.
# This is generally used to communicate timestamped data

# Two-integer timestamp that is expressed as seconds and nanoseconds.

# This contains the position of a point in free space(with 32 bits of precision).
# It is recommended to use Point wherever possible instead of Point32.
#
# This recommendation is to promote interoperability.
#
# This message is designed to take up less space when sending
# lots of points at once, as in the case of a PointCloud.

# This message is used by the PointCloud message to hold optional data
# associated with each point in the cloud. The length of the values
# array should be the same as the length of the points array in the
# PointCloud, and each value should be associated with the corresponding
# point.
#
# Channel names in existing practice include:
#   "u", "v" - row and column (respectively) in the left stereo image.
#              This is opposite to usual conventions but remains for
#              historical reasons. The newer PointCloud2 message has no
#              such problem.
#   "rgb" - For point clouds produced by color stereo cameras. uint8
#           (R,G,B) values packed into the least significant 24 bits,
#           in order.
#   "intensity" - laser or pixel intensity.
#   "distance"

# The channel name should give semantics of the channel (e.g.
# "intensity" instead of "value").
string name

# The values array should be 1-1 with the elements of the associated
# PointCloud.
