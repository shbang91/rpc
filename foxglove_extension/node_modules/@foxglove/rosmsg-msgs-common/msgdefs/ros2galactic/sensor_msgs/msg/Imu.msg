# This is a message to hold data from an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
#
# Accelerations should be in m/s^2 (not in g's), and rotational velocity should be in rad/sec
#
# If the covariance of the measurement is known, it should be filled in (if all you know is the
# variance of each measurement, e.g. from the datasheet, just put those along the diagonal)
# A covariance matrix of all zeros will be interpreted as "covariance unknown", and to use the
# data a covariance will have to be assumed or gotten from some other source
#
# If you have no estimate for one of the data elements (e.g. your IMU doesn't produce an
# orientation estimate), please set element 0 of the associated covariance matrix to -1
# If you are interpreting this message, please check for a value of -1 in the first element of each
# covariance matrix, and disregard the associated estimate.

# This represents a vector in free space.

# This is semantically different than a point.
# A vector is always anchored at the origin.
# When a transform is applied to a vector, only the rotational component is applied.
