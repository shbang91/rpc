# This is generally used to communicate timestamped data
# in a particular coordinate frame.

# Two-integer timestamp that is expressed as seconds and nanoseconds.

# This expresses velocity in free space with uncertainty.

Twist twist

# Row-major representation of the 6x6 covariance matrix
# The orientation parameters use a fixed-axis representation.
# In order, the parameters are:
# (x, y, z, rotation about X axis, rotation about Y axis, rotation about Z axis)

# This represents a vector in free space.

# This is semantically different than a point.
# A vector is always anchored at the origin.
# When a transform is applied to a vector, only the rotational component is applied.
