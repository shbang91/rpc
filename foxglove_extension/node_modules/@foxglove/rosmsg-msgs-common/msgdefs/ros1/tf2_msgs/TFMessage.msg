geometry_msgs/TransformStamped[] transforms

================================================================================
MSG: geometry_msgs/TransformStamped
# This expresses a transform from coordinate frame header.frame_id
# to the coordinate frame child_frame_id
#
# This message is mostly used by the
# <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/tf">tf</a> package.
# See its documentation for more information.

Header header
string child_frame_id # the frame id of the child frame
Transform transform

================================================================================
MSG: std_msgs/Header
# Standard metadata for higher-level stamped data types.
# This is generally used to communicate timestamped data
# in a particular coordinate frame.
#
# sequence ID: consecutively increasing ID
uint32 seq
#Two-integer timestamp that is expressed as:
# * stamp.sec: seconds (stamp_secs) since epoch (in Python the variable is called 'secs')
# * stamp.nsec: nanoseconds since stamp_secs (in Python the variable is called 'nsecs')
# time-handling sugar is provided by the client library
time stamp
#Frame this data is associated with
string frame_id

================================================================================
MSG: geometry_msgs/Transform
# This represents the transform between two coordinate frames in free space.

Vector3 translation
Quaternion rotation

================================================================================
MSG: geometry_msgs/Vector3
# This represents a vector in free space.
# It is only meant to represent a direction. Therefore, it does not
# make sense to apply a translation to it (e.g., when applying a
# generic rigid transformation to a Vector3, tf2 will only apply the
# rotation). If you want your data to be translatable too, use the
# geometry_msgs/Point message instead.

float64 x
float64 y
float64 z
================================================================================
MSG: geometry_msgs/Quaternion
# This represents an orientation in free space in quaternion form.
