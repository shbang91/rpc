# nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid
# This represents a 2-D grid map, in which each cell represents the probability of
# occupancy.

Header header

#MetaData for the map
MapMetaData info

# The map data, in row-major order, starting with (0,0).  Occupancy
# probabilities are in the range [0,100].  Unknown is -1.
int8[] data

================================================================================
MSG: std_msgs/Header
# Standard metadata for higher-level stamped data types.
# This is generally used to communicate timestamped data
# in a particular coordinate frame.
#
# sequence ID: consecutively increasing ID
uint32 seq
#Two-integer timestamp that is expressed as:
# * stamp.sec: seconds (stamp_secs) since epoch (in Python the variable is called 'secs')
# * stamp.nsec: nanoseconds since stamp_secs (in Python the variable is called 'nsecs')
# time-handling sugar is provided by the client library
time stamp
#Frame this data is associated with
string frame_id

================================================================================
MSG: nav_msgs/MapMetaData
# This hold basic information about the characterists of the OccupancyGrid

# The time at which the map was loaded
time map_load_time
# The map resolution [m/cell]
float32 resolution
# Map width [cells]
uint32 width
# Map height [cells]
uint32 height
# The origin of the map [m, m, rad].  This is the real-world pose of the
# cell (0,0) in the map.
geometry_msgs/Pose origin
================================================================================
MSG: geometry_msgs/Pose
# A representation of pose in free space, composed of position and orientation.
