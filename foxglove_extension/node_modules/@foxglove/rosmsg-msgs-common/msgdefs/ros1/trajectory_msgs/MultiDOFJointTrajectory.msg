# trajectory_msgs/MultiDOFJointTrajectory
# The header is used to specify the coordinate frame and the reference time for the trajectory durations
Header header

# A representation of a multi-dof joint trajectory (each point is a transformation)
# Each point along the trajectory will include an array of positions/velocities/accelerations
# that has the same length as the array of joint names, and has the same order of joints as
# the joint names array.

string[] joint_names

MSG: std_msgs/Header
# Standard metadata for higher-level stamped data types.
# This is generally used to communicate timestamped data
# in a particular coordinate frame.
#
# sequence ID: consecutively increasing ID
uint32 seq
#Two-integer timestamp that is expressed as:
# * stamp.sec: seconds (stamp_secs) since epoch (in Python the variable is called 'secs')
# * stamp.nsec: nanoseconds since stamp_secs (in Python the variable is called 'nsecs')
# time-handling sugar is provided by the client library
time stamp
#Frame this data is associated with
string frame_id

MSG: trajectory_msgs/MultiDOFJointTrajectoryPoint
# Each multi-dof joint can specify a transform (up to 6 DOF)
geometry_msgs/Transform[] transforms

# There can be a velocity specified for the origin of the joint
geometry_msgs/Twist[] velocities

# There can be an acceleration specified for the origin of the joint
geometry_msgs/Twist[] accelerations

================================================================================
MSG: geometry_msgs/Transform
# This represents the transform between two coordinate frames in free space.

Vector3 translation
Quaternion rotation

================================================================================
MSG: geometry_msgs/Vector3
# This represents a vector in free space.
# It is only meant to represent a direction. Therefore, it does not
# make sense to apply a translation to it (e.g., when applying a
# generic rigid transformation to a Vector3, tf2 will only apply the
# rotation). If you want your data to be translatable too, use the
# geometry_msgs/Point message instead.

float64 x
float64 y
float64 z
================================================================================
MSG: geometry_msgs/Quaternion
# This represents an orientation in free space in quaternion form.

================================================================================
MSG: geometry_msgs/Twist
# This expresses velocity in free space broken into its linear and angular parts.
