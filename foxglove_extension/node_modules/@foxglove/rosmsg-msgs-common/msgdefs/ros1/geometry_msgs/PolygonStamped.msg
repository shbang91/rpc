MSG: std_msgs/Header
# Standard metadata for higher-level stamped data types.
# This is generally used to communicate timestamped data
# in a particular coordinate frame.
#
# sequence ID: consecutively increasing ID
uint32 seq
#Two-integer timestamp that is expressed as:
# * stamp.sec: seconds (stamp_secs) since epoch (in Python the variable is called 'secs')
# * stamp.nsec: nanoseconds since stamp_secs (in Python the variable is called 'nsecs')
# time-handling sugar is provided by the client library
time stamp
#Frame this data is associated with
string frame_id

MSG: geometry_msgs/Polygon
#A specification of a polygon where the first and last points are assumed to be connected
Point32[] points

================================================================================
MSG: geometry_msgs/Point32
# This contains the position of a point in free space(with 32 bits of precision).
# It is recommeded to use Point wherever possible instead of Point32.
#
# This recommendation is to promote interoperability.
#
# This message is designed to take up less space when sending
# lots of points at once, as in the case of a PointCloud.
