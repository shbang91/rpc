# sensor_msgs/Range
# Single range reading from an active ranger that emits energy and reports
# one range reading that is valid along an arc at the distance measured.
# This message is  not appropriate for laser scanners. See the LaserScan
# message if you are working with a laser scanner.

# This message also can represent a fixed-distance (binary) ranger.  This
# sensor will have min_range===max_range===distance of detection.
# These sensors follow REP 117 and will output -Inf if the object is detected
# and +Inf if the object is outside of the detection range.

float32 field_of_view   # the size of the arc that the distance reading is
                        # valid for [rad]
                        # the object causing the range reading may have
                        # been anywhere within -field_of_view/2 and
                        # field_of_view/2 at the measured range.
                        # 0 angle corresponds to the x-axis of the sensor.

                        # Fixed distance rangers only output -Inf or +Inf.
                        # -Inf represents a detection within fixed distance.
                        # (Detection too close to the sensor to quantify)
                        # +Inf represents no detection within the fixed distance.

#Two-integer timestamp that is expressed as:
# * stamp.sec: seconds (stamp_secs) since epoch (in Python the variable is called 'secs')
# * stamp.nsec: nanoseconds since stamp_secs (in Python the variable is called 'nsecs')
