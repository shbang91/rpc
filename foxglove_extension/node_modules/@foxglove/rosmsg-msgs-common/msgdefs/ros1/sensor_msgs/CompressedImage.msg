# sensor_msgs/CompressedImage
# This message contains a compressed image

Header header        # Header timestamp should be acquisition time of image
                     # Header frame_id should be optical frame of camera
                     # origin of frame should be optical center of camera
                     # +x should point to the right in the image
                     # +y should point down in the image
                     # +z should point into to plane of the image

string format        # Specifies the format of the data
                     #   Acceptable values:
                     #     jpeg, png
uint8[] data         # Compressed image buffer

MSG: std_msgs/Header
# Standard metadata for higher-level stamped data types.
# This is generally used to communicate timestamped data
# in a particular coordinate frame.
#
# sequence ID: consecutively increasing ID
uint32 seq
#Two-integer timestamp that is expressed as:
# * stamp.sec: seconds (stamp_secs) since epoch (in Python the variable is called 'secs')
# * stamp.nsec: nanoseconds since stamp_secs (in Python the variable is called 'nsecs')
# time-handling sugar is provided by the client library
time stamp
#Frame this data is associated with
string frame_id
