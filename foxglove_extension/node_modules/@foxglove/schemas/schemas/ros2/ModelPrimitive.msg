# A primitive representing a 3D model file loaded from an external URL or embedded data

# Generated by https://github.com/foxglove/schemas

# Origin of model relative to reference frame
geometry_msgs/Pose pose

# Scale factor to apply to the model along each axis
geometry_msgs/Vector3 scale

# Solid color to use for the whole model if `override_color` is true.
foxglove_msgs/Color color

# Whether to use the color specified in `color` instead of any materials embedded in the original model.
bool override_color

string media_type
