# foxglove_msgs/msg/LaserScan
# A single scan from a planar laser range-finder

# Generated by https://github.com/foxglove/schemas

# Timestamp of scan
builtin_interfaces/Time timestamp

# Frame of reference
string frame_id

# Origin of scan relative to frame of reference; points are positioned in the x-y plane relative to this origin; angles are interpreted as counterclockwise rotations around the z axis with 0 rad being in the +x direction
geometry_msgs/Pose pose

# Bearing of first point, in radians
float64 start_angle

# Bearing of last point, in radians
float64 end_angle

# Distance of detections from origin; assumed to be at equally-spaced angles between `start_angle` and `end_angle`
float64[] ranges

# Intensity of detections
float64[] intensities
