# foxglove_msgs/SceneEntity
# A visual element in a 3D scene. An entity may be composed of multiple primitives which all share the same frame of reference.

# Generated by https://github.com/foxglove/schemas

# Timestamp of the entity
time timestamp

# Frame of reference
string frame_id

# Identifier for the entity. A entity will replace any prior entity on the same topic with the same `id`.
string id

# Length of time (relative to `timestamp`) after which the entity should be automatically removed. Zero value indicates the entity should remain visible until it is replaced or deleted.
duration lifetime

# Whether the entity should keep its location in the fixed frame (false) or follow the frame specified in `frame_id` as it moves relative to the fixed frame (true)
bool frame_locked

# Additional user-provided metadata associated with the entity. Keys must be unique.
