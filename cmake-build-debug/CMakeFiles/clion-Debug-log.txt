CMake Error at /snap/clion/265/bin/cmake/linux/x64/share/cmake-3.27/Modules/CMakeFindDependencyMacro.cmake:76 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findurdfdom_headers.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "urdfdom_headers", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "urdfdom_headers"
  with any of the following names:

    urdfdom_headersConfig.cmake
    urdfdom_headers-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "urdfdom_headers" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "urdfdom_headers_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "urdfdom_headers" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
